Sorry if I'm breaking any rules here, this is my first post, but I can't get the program to sort anything for me. There might be something glaringly obvious I'm missing but I can't figure it out. This is the code from my textbook.

It said that I was exceeding Array Parameters so I changed the N-1 in (I=0;I<N-1;I++) to N-2 and the subsequent N to N-1 and it compiled, but still would not sort.
